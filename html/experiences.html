                    <p>
                      In this first mission, the goal was to learn the company policy and their workflow. I had to acclimate myself to the software Valeo were using, their methods and the general concept of an embedded software engineer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It consisted in doing some changing in the libraries created and used by Valeo. It allows me to learn about major <b>C++ programming and OOP concepts</b> while developing following a <b>Test-Driven Development</b> (TDD).

                <div>
                  In this second mission, the goal was to develop a fully-functional application from a simple UML. The application dealed about <b>Inter-Process Communication</b> (IPC) in a <b>Real-Time Operating System</b> (RTOS) developed by QNX.
                </div>
                <div>
                  The mission helped me creating, testing, organizing and managing a full project with external dependencies (the ones from my first mission - which were not as functional as they should be (it's always with other projects that we realize the misconceptions...)). I also had to assist to meetings about the project in general and how my application should connect with others.
                </div>
                  <div>
                    Finally, I had to stress-test the entire application to make sure the performance were respecting its specifications.

                    <p> The goal of this third mission was to develop a system that pixelate a certain area of an image. The requirements were that the area(s) was(were) defined by a certain number of point (from 2 to 15) and that the pixelation time should be less than a maximum time.</p>
                    <p>Technically, I used a <b>internal Vulkan engine</b>  by Valeo and had to learn the Vulkan basics in order to program the system. First, it was pretty difficult to understand the engine but once I understood (a glimpse of) the philosophy behind Vulkan, it was easier. Then, the results were more optimized and the process time significatively less important.</p>

                  <p>This last mission was about to develop a color-space convertor that is able to convert a image in RGB format to a image using the YUV format, for instance. To developp this convertor, I had to research color formats, their uses, both in the company and in the world of camera vision, and their conversion methods. </p>
                  <p>This whole conversion system has been then  in the Vulkan engine using specific compute shaders. </p>
