        Because I had to study my exams during the winter break of 2023 (wonderful movie I've you haven't seen it!), I had a lot of idea on "what to do else than my exams"  and this website is the main consequence.

        This is not a merveillous website with a lot of animation, colors or incredible project. This is just the website of a simple man who wanted to make one. You won't find a man drivent by computer science, just a man who likes this topic and who decided to work in that field.
